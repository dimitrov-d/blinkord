## Overview

Blinks ü§ù Discord = Blinkord

Blinkord is a platform design for allowing Discord community owners to enable Solana interactions directly within their server. Server owners can create their own Blinks on Blinkord, or they can use external blink URLs within the Discord app if the Blinkord Bot is added to the server.

Blinkord greatly enhances the user experience and satisfaction, which in turn also increases the conversion rate for users to be able to execute transactions on Solana within the Discord app. On the other hand, Discord community owners can create a customized Blink for their server through a very simple and intuitive process.

Payments are made in SOL (Solana), leveraging the power of Solana Actions and Blinks for a secure and streamlined experience.

## Platform Features
- **Customizable Blinks**: Server owners can customize the appearance and details of their Blinks, including title, description, icon, and promotional message, providing a personalized experience for their community.
- **Easy Role Management**: Server owners can quickly create custom links that grant users access to premium roles in their Discord server. They can select which roles to offer and set the cost for each role, including options for discounts and limited-time only roles.
- **Role Expiration Management**: Server owners can set limited-time roles with expiration dates, allowing for dynamic role management and encouraging users to renew their roles. The system automatically removes expired roles and notifies users via direct messages on Discord, ensuring that the server remains organized and up-to-date.
- **Seamless Member Onboarding**: Members can obtain exclusive roles with just a few clicks. The process requires no sign up and no personal information in order to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. This seamless structure also increases purchase conversion rate of blinks.
- **Blinkord Marketplace**: A simple hub which features all Blinks created through Blinkord. Go to Blinkord Marketplace to learn more.
- **Discord OAuth Integration**: The application utilizes Discord OAuth for secure authentication, allowing users to log in seamlessly and manage their roles without exposing sensitive information.
- **Solana Integration**: All transactions are processed using SOL, ensuring fast and secure payments. The system supports transaction tracking and confirmation to enhance reliability. The transactions are executed through Solana Blinks (blockchain links) and can be triggered from any web app that supports blinks.
